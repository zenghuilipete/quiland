http://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-surefire-plugin/
The Surefire Plugin is used during the test phase of the build lifecycle to execute the unit tests of an application. It generates reports in 2 different file formats:

    Plain text files (*.txt)
    XML files (*.xml)

By default, these files are generated at ${basedir}/target/surefire-reports.

For an HTML format of the report, please see the Maven Surefire Report Plugin.
