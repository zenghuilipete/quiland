The basic camps they fall into are:
	Key/value
	A familiar data model, much like a hashtable.
	Column family
	An extended key/value data model in which the value data type can also be a sequence
	of key/value pairs.
	Document
	Collections that contain semistructured data, such as XML or JSON.
	Graph
	Based on graph theory. The data model has nodes and edges, each of which may
	have properties.
